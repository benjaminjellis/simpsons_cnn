# simpsons_cnn

This is a quick project to look at transfer learning to trian a model to classify pictures of Simpsons characters.

I took two apporaches:
1) Using keras and tensorflow to add a classifer to the top of pretained resenet50 (~70% accuracy w/o fine tuning)
2) Using fast.ai to add a classifier to the top of pretrained resent model (~90% accuracy in one cycle)
