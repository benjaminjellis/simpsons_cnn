# simpsons_cnn

This is a quick project to explore computer vision using a dataset of Simpsons characters.

## Simple Classifier
First experiment is a simple classifier of images where only one character is present. I built a custom dataset where each character class contains 700 images. I utilised the kaggle dataset (linked above) and over / under sampled where aprropriate. 

The results from this can be found in simple_classification/classifier.ipynb
